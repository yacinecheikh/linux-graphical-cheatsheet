# linux-graphical-cheatsheet
Dot graph of all the components in a usual Linux distro:

### Some ways to use this graph
* Check your existing knowledge of Linux
* Discover parts of your system that you were not aware of
* Knowing where to look for when doing something on a Unix system.


### Todo
This graph is missing tons of information. I made the first version in under 1h, so I am already aware that I missed a lot of things.
I plan to complete this over time, but if you want to see something added, please contact me (by opening an issue for example).

There are also features that are too specific (like the guix package manager) to be covered in this graph or unrelated to Linux (like my personal Monero wallet RPC cheatsheet), so I plan to add other graphs some day.
